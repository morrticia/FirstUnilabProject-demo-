#First Unilab project (demo version)
##App which tokenizes the sentences and tags them using "nltk" library
methods used:  
1. word_tokenize - Takes a single word separately form a sentence.
2. pos_tag - Part-of-speech tagging. This method gives us particular grammatical value of a word in sentence.
